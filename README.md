# Matplotlib Styles

These are a few stylesheets I use for plots in papers, presentations,
or just generally.

In order to use them, clone the repo and set the `MPLCONFIGDIR` environment
variable to the path to this directory. For example, in your `.bashrc` have:

```bash
export MPLCONFIGDIR=$HOME/repos/mpl_styles
```

Matplotlib looks for the `.mplstyle` files in `$MPLCONFIGDIR/stylelib`.
